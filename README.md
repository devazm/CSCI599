‚ÄúTwo things are infinite , the universe and human stupidity and we are not sure about the universe‚Äù.
The rules are simple , how about you ? Use your reflexes , crazy skills and logic to answer simple(not really) questions and try to level up!
"Tap , Shake or Kiss your phone"- nothing is impossible. Brain it on ! ‚úåüèª


## 1. No Tickets , No Matches!

We employ the concepts of tickets to play a match! Tickets are nothing but your pass to enter a match. Each player begins with 5 tickets , which continuously gets exhausted whenever a player enters a match. But don‚Äôt worry! The tickets are renewable resources unlike coal and petrol. Tickets have a special power to replenish themselves within half an hour so that players can re-enter a match. 

## 2. Simple Rule : Beat your opponent

A player encounters a random player. Both the players go through a series of 10 mind boggling , but smart questions. The rules are simple , the more accurately and timely you answer , the better chances you have to take away the game. 


## 3. Simple Maths , more fun!

The scoring is simple. Each player faces 10 rounds(10 questions) and each round is 10 seconds. For each correct answer the user gets 10 points + (points of the remaining timer). For example, user A answers accurately in 2 seconds , then his score will be 10 + 8(seconds left) = 18. 

Similarly if a user B answers accurately , but in 4 seconds , his score will be 10 + 6(seconds left) = 16.
Simple math , but it is very efficient and also helps us to solve           problems such as tiebreakers.  


## 4. Now let‚Äôs add complexity!

What happens upon winning or losing a match?

If a player wins a match , they get coins and a lot of Experience Points(XP). If a player loses a match they get some Experience Points(XP) and less coins. Experience points is used to decide the level of a player. Each level has a tag associated with it. And whenever a person unlocks a new level , they can use a new tag under their name. 

Also , a new level doesn‚Äôt mean just a new tag. It also means a pack of special items , because we also have a marketplace ;)


## 5. Trust me , you need coins!

Whenever a user plays a match they get coins. We have a marketplace from which a user can buy a plethora of boost ups ranging from tickets(pt. 1) , hints (that could be used in a question) , spin of wheel (Surprise! Because, even we don‚Äôt know about it yet!) and tags.
